## Features

### Vault-native Codex Workspace

- Opens Codex in the Obsidian sidebar.
- Uses the current vault as the working directory.
- Lets Codex read notes, inspect folders, edit documents, and run local commands.
- Keeps the workflow inside Obsidian instead of bouncing between apps.

### Agent-style Process Timeline

- Renders reasoning, commands, file edits, MCP calls, and context usage as readable process cards.
- Shows file chips for touched files, with vault files opening back in Obsidian.
- Keeps large outputs and raw details folded away so the conversation stays readable.
- Supports Agent / Plan mode, model selection, reasoning effort, speed, and file permission modes.

### Local-first Integration

- Reuses your local Codex CLI login state.
- Does not require storing an OpenAI API key by default.
- Supports local proxy settings for the Codex child process.
- Keeps plugin, MCP, and skill switches scoped to the current vault instead of rewriting global Codex config.

## Install

1. Install and log in to Codex CLI.
2. Download `obsidian-codex-0.1.0.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/AKin-lvyifang/obsidian-codex/releases/tag/v0.1.0).
3. Unzip it and get the `obsidian-codex` folder.
4. Move it into your vault plugin directory:

```text
<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-codex/
```

5. Restart Obsidian and enable `Codex for Obsidian` in Community plugins.

The plugin folder should contain:

```text
obsidian-codex/
  main.js
  manifest.json
  styles.css
```

## Quick Start

1. Open the Codex sidebar from the ribbon icon or command palette.
2. Ask Codex to inspect, summarize, rewrite, or manage files in the current vault.
3. Attach notes, files, images, skills, or MCP tools when needed.
4. Review the process cards for commands, edits, context usage, and evidence.

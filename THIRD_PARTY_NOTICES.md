## Magic UI

EchoInk vendors the official Magic UI `BentoGrid`, `AnimatedShinyText`,
shared `cn` utility, and shadcn-compatible `Button` sources at commit
`2d671cc6c0e0f40e28682c9cbddd16694dcfe627`. The upstream global animation
declarations are retained locally as provenance for the isolated build-time
Tailwind CSS output.

## Vercel AI Elements

EchoInk includes modified native Obsidian TypeScript DOM and CSS adaptations
of the Vercel AI Elements `Sources` component for local document provenance,
the read-only `Task` component used for durable task-plan history, the
`Question` and `Confirmation` interaction semantics, and the `Attachments`
container, preview, info, and remove semantics, plus the `Shimmer` text-loading
effect used while an Assistant reply is being prepared.
The adaptation replaces React, Radix Collapsible, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide with
the existing Obsidian DOM and icon APIs, and it intentionally omits the
upstream external-link behavior.

EchoInk includes dependency-free native SVG and CSS adaptations of the
AnimateIcons Lucide `Upload`, `Mic`, `Send Horizontal`, `Circle Stop`, `Users`,
